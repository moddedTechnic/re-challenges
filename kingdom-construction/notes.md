# Notes

## Intended Solution Pathway

1) Enter text into job request box
2) Job request should contain script injection
3) Override `getMessage()` function to return `flag`
4) Add another message, which will now return the flag

## Flag

`FLAG{Cl1ft0n_5uspens10n_Br1dge}`


## Hints

1) We believe that you, the client, should be able to inject any codes and restrictions you may require.
2) We believe that the flag of this country should be planted firmly upon the mountain that is engineering.
3) We believe that everyone should be able to get messages from any source they wish.
